class PrettyGoodOscillator(Indicator):

    """Pretty Good Oscillator - takes the distance of the current close from its
    simple moving average, measuring this value against the average true range,
    outputting the ratio.

    The suggested approach is to use this indicator as a breakout system for
    longer-term trades. If the PGO value rises above 3.0, a long position should
    be taken. If the value drops below -3.0, then a short position should be
    taken. In both cases, the exit condition is reached when the output returns
    to zero.

    The default period is set to 14, but can be overridden when calling the
    function.

    Requires one mandatory parameter, 'data', with an additional optional
    parameter, 'period'. Examples:

        - PrettyGoodOscillator(self.data, period=self.params.period)
        - PrettyGoodOscillator(self.data, period=self.p.period)
        - PrettyGoodOscillator(self.data, period=14)
        - PrettyGoodOscillator(self.data)

    Formula:
    
        - pgo = (data.close - sma(data, period)) / atr(data, period)

    Notes:

        - Although the standard moving average is the SMA, this can be switched
          to any other. For example, use WMA by including _movav=WMA in the
          function.
        - PrettyGoodOscillator(self.data, _movav=WMA)
